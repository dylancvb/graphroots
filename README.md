Data science for Grassroots Festival in Trumansburg, NY

Hi there! Looking for more information on this data science art installation? I've decided that it's more in the spirit of the project to keep it analog, for the most part. If you have questions about technical stuff and my methods, or if you're an artist who wants to know more about the data, please send me an email (dcv26@cornell.edu) and I'll respond ASAP!

After the festival is complete, I'll attach a link here to a digital copy of the installation!
