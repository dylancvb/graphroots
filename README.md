**Data science for Grassroots Festival in Trumansburg, NY**

Looking for more _technical_ information on this data science art installation? I've decided that it's more in the spirit of the project to keep it analog, for the most part. If you have questions about my methods using the Spotify Web API and plotting packages, or if you're an artist who wants to know more about the data I collected, please send me an email (dcv26@cornell.edu).

For pictures of what the installation actually looked like during the festival, see the installation_pictures folder (note how many more things were on the wall later on - we had some amazing participation)! 

To see everything really "data science" oriented, check out GraphRootsScans-compressed.pdf . Here, the first ~20 pages are my analysis, accompanied by some self-reflection and audience feedback. After that, it's all graph-related art completed by me, my friends, and all of the wonderful participants who interacted with this exhibit!
